# The Intelligent Machine Research Lab (IMRL)

The Intelligent Machine Research Lab [IMRL](https://sites.google.com/view/huikonglab/home)
 at [The University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo) is a scientific unit that is devoted to conducting both fundamental and applied research in autonomous driving and mobile robotics. We exploit varieties of sensors (cameras, Lidars, Radars, GPS, wheel odometer, and IMU, etc) to fulfill tasks of machine perception, SLAM, autonomous navigation, motion planning, behavior prediction, Lidar sensing, and sensor fusion.
